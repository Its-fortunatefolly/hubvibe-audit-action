# HubVibe WCAG SEO and Security Audit

**Catch accessibility, SEO, security-header and performance regressions in the pull request that caused them — not in an audit six months later.**

Runs against your deployed preview or staging URL and fails the build if it regresses. Every check is a deterministic rule against the real rendered page. No LLM decides whether your site is compliant.

```yaml
- uses: Its-fortunatefolly/hubvibe-audit-action@v1
  with:
    url: https://staging.example.com
    api-key: ${{ secrets.HUBVIBE_API_KEY }}
```

That's the whole integration.

## The whole file, if you'd rather paste one

Save as `.github/workflows/hubvibe-audit.yml`, edit the one URL, add
`HUBVIBE_API_KEY` to your repository secrets. Every push to `main` and every
pull request is audited from then on.

```yaml
name: HubVibe Site Compliance Audit

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

env:
  # The one line to edit. Your deployed preview, staging, or production URL.
  AUDIT_URL: https://your-site.example.com

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: Its-fortunatefolly/hubvibe-audit-action@v1
        with:
          url: ${{ env.AUDIT_URL }}
          api-key: ${{ secrets.HUBVIBE_API_KEY }}
          endpoint: bundle          # or: wcag, seo, security, performance
          fail-on-violation: true   # your regressions gate the build
          fail-on-error: false      # our outage does not
```

## What it checks

| | |
|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.1 A/AA via axe-core, against the rendered DOM — constrained to exactly those rule tags, so a pass means what it says |
| **SEO** | title, meta description, H1 structure, canonical, OpenGraph, structured data, `lang` |
| **Security headers** | HTTPS, HSTS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, clickjacking, Referrer-Policy, CORS |
| **Performance** | DOM node count, transferred bytes, request count from one real page load |

## Findings land in the job summary

Not buried in log output. A reviewer opens the Checks tab and sees the rule, its impact, how many nodes it hit, and a link to the fix:

| Rule | Impact | Nodes | Help |
|---|---|---|---|
| `color-contrast` | serious | 4 | [Elements must have sufficient contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/color-contrast) |
| `image-alt` | critical | 2 | [Images must have alternate text](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/image-alt) |

## Three things it will not do to you

**It won't lie about a check that didn't run.** If a dimension fails to execute, the call fails and reports an error. It is never counted as a pass. A green build means the checks actually ran.

**It won't block your deploy when our service has a bad day.** Set `fail-on-error: false` and infrastructure failures — network, timeout, our outage — become a warning. Real findings still gate the build:

```yaml
- uses: Its-fortunatefolly/hubvibe-audit-action@v1
  with:
    url: https://staging.example.com
    api-key: ${{ secrets.HUBVIBE_API_KEY }}
    fail-on-error: false      # our outage never blocks your release
    fail-on-violation: true   # your regressions still do
```

**It won't guess.** axe-core for accessibility, a real HTTP response for headers, a real browser page load for performance. Deterministic rules, same input same output, no model in the loop deciding whether your site "looks compliant."

## What it costs

**$0.03** per single audit. **$0.10** for all four as one bundle.

Concretely: a repo merging 100 pull requests a month, running the full bundle on each, spends **$10/month**. Running only the accessibility check, **$3/month**. No subscription, no seat licence, no minimum — you are billed for calls you make.

You can also pay per call over HTTP 402 with no account at all, which is what the API is really built for. See [`/.well-known/agent.json`](https://hubvibe-831480473793.us-south1.run.app/.well-known/agent.json) — it lists live prices and the payment rails that can actually settle right now, and it is generated from the same catalog the routes charge from, so it cannot drift from what you are billed.

## Try it before wiring it up

An unauthenticated call tells you the price and how to pay — no signup:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://hubvibe-831480473793.us-south1.run.app/audit/wcag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | yes | — | The live URL to audit. |
| `api-key` | no | — | Your key. Without it the run reports the service's 402 and how to pay. |
| `endpoint` | no | `bundle` | `wcag`, `seo`, `security`, `performance`, or `bundle`. |
| `fail-on-violation` | no | `true` | `false` reports findings without failing the build. |
| `fail-on-error` | no | `true` | `false` makes infrastructure failures a warning. |
| `timeout-seconds` | no | `90` | Per-attempt HTTP timeout. |
| `retries` | no | `2` | Retries on network error or 5xx. A 4xx is never retried. |
| `base-url` | no | hosted | Override for self-hosted deployments. |

## Outputs

| Output | |
|---|---|
| `passed` | `"true"` / `"false"` — the overall result. |
| `response` | Raw JSON response body. |
| `http-status` | Status of the final attempt (`000` if it never completed). |

## Gate a deploy on it

```yaml
- name: Audit staging
  id: audit
  uses: Its-fortunatefolly/hubvibe-audit-action@v1
  with:
    url: https://staging.example.com
    api-key: ${{ secrets.HUBVIBE_API_KEY }}

- name: Promote to production
  if: steps.audit.outputs.passed == 'true'
  run: ./deploy-production.sh
```

## Getting a key

Keys come from [the service](https://hubvibe-831480473793.us-south1.run.app). Store it as a repository secret named `HUBVIBE_API_KEY`.

If you would rather not hold a key at all, the endpoints accept per-call machine payment over HTTP 402 — nothing to store, nothing to rotate.
